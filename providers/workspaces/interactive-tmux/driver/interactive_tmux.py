"""Host-side driver for the `interactive-tmux` workspace provider.

Five public primitives (matches the EXP-05 contract the orchestrator
specified):

  start_workspace(name, host_auth, image, ...) -> InteractiveTmuxWorkspace
  ws.send_message(agent, text)
  ws.await_completion(agent, timeout)
  ws.capture_response(agent)
  ws.stop()

The driver encodes the per-agent matrix discovered in EXP-01..04 so callers
do NOT see per-agent quirks:

  * Claude:
      - submit  = `send-keys -l text` then `send-keys Enter` (two-step)
      - init    = pre-seed ~/.claude.json with hasCompletedOnboarding/theme/
                  projects.<workspace>.hasTrustDialogAccepted (avoids the
                  theme picker and the per-project trust dialog)
      - auth    = mount ~/.claude (for .credentials.json) AND ~/.claude.json
                  (for oauthAccount metadata — without it, claude falls back
                  to API Usage Billing instead of Max plan)
      - ready   = three-signal heuristic: no "esc to interrupt", empty `❯ `
                  prompt line, "? for shortcuts" footer present
  * Codex:
      - submit  = `send-keys text` then `C-j C-m` (first-send gotcha:
                  bare C-m alone often does not dispatch the first message)
      - init    = `codex --no-alt-screen`, then `1` Enter for trust banner,
                  then Escape to close hooks-review screen
      - auth    = mount ~/.codex
      - ready   = `• Working` marker absent and a known idle-state marker
                  visible
  * Gemini:
      - submit  = `send-keys text Enter` (NEVER C-m — confirmed by EXP-03)
      - init    = pre-patch ~/.gemini/settings.json with
                  security.folderTrust.enabled = false, then `gemini` Enter
      - auth    = mount ~/.gemini
      - ready   = `Type your message` prompt indicator present

Standard library only (Python 3.11+). Designed to be importable AND runnable
as a CLI (`python -m interactive_tmux`).

    See EXP-05's "Open contradiction" section for the empirical resolution
    of where the OAuth token lives, and EXP-05a for the full 2×2 mount
    matrix proving BOTH files are required.

    Synthetic ~/.claude.json policy (EXP-05 codex cross-review m1):
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    EXP-05a tested four mount combinations on the host (`none`, `.claude`
    only, `.claude.json` only, both). Only "both" yielded an authenticated
    start. This adapter, however, ALWAYS synthesizes ~/.claude.json in
    the container even when the host's ~/.claude.json is absent. The
    synthesized file carries onboarding-skip markers, the workspace's
    project-trust map, and (when available) the host's `oauthAccount`
    metadata copied through. Token material is never synthesized — only
    `~/.claude/.credentials.json` carries tokens, and it MUST exist on
    the host. Concretely:

      - host has `.claude/` + `.claude.json` → both copied; behaves
        identically to EXP-05a's "both" cell (authenticated start, no
        wizards).
      - host has `.claude/` only             → `.claude/.credentials.json`
        copied; `.claude.json` is SYNTHESIZED. This case is OUTSIDE
        EXP-05a's matrix; it works because the synthesized file supplies
        the onboarding/trust markers Claude expects, while the tokens
        come from `.credentials.json`. Functionally equivalent to "both"
        for this provider.
      - host has neither                     → `prepare_host_auth`
        raises (we never start a container that can't authenticate).

    Net: callers do not need to manage `.claude.json` themselves; this
    adapter's fallback is the recommended path. If a consumer wants to
    suppress synthesis and mount their own `.claude.json` byte-for-byte,
    they should call `host_auth["claude"] = …` with a directory that
    contains both `.credentials.json` AND a sibling `.claude.json` — but
    the synthesized file is the path EXP-05a's "both" outcome generalizes
    to inside this container image.

                Keys: "claude" (path to ~/.claude), "codex" (~/.codex),
                "gemini" (~/.gemini). A value of None disables that agent's
                pane (it is not launched).
            image: docker image tag to run.
            workdir: container working directory (also keyed into claude's
                project-trust map).
            tmux_size: (cols, rows) for the tmux session. The default 200x50
                fixes EXP-01 FRICTION F-3 (default 80x24 truncates the TUI).
            startup_timeout_s: how long to wait per agent for its idle/ready
                state before giving up.
            strict_startup: if True (default), raise `StartupReadinessError`
                when any enabled agent fails to reach `is_ready()` within
                `startup_timeout_s`. If False, log a warning and return the

                callers can inspect status before `send_message`. EXP-05
                cross-review M1: bare success on a missed readiness gate is
                a footgun for orchestrators like Syntropic137. Strict is the
                safer default; lax is opt-in for callers who already check
                `ws.startup_status` themselves.
            host_claude_dotjson: explicit host-side path to `~/.claude.json`.
                If `None` (default), the driver looks for it as a sibling of
                `host_auth["claude"]` — which is correct when the caller runs
                outside a container. Inside a container (docker-out-of-docker),
                the operator's `.claude.json` may be mounted at an unrelated
                path; pass it explicitly here. Equivalent to setting
                `ITMUX_CLAUDE_JSON` in the environment. Surfaced as a bug fix
                for the Syntropic137 integration e2e (PR #202 follow-up).
            claude_plugin_dirs: list of container-side paths to load as Claude
                Code plugin dirs. The driver launches `claude --plugin-dir P1
                --plugin-dir P2 ...` — the only mechanism that actually loads
                plugins into the tmux-driven TUI (settings.json injection is
                silently ignored; proven by Syntropic137's workflow-skills
                bridge experiment, `docs/plans/workflow-skills.md` §9).
                Equivalent to setting `ITMUX_CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIRS` (colon-
                separated, like `$PATH`).

        Returns:
            InteractiveTmuxWorkspace. In both strict and lax modes,
            `ws.startup_status` is populated with per-agent `AwaitResult`s.

        EXP-05 codex cross-review M3: returns an `AwaitResult` mirroring
        `agentic_isolation.ExecuteResult` (`timed_out`/`reason`/`duration_ms`)
        so orchestrators can distinguish failure modes. Existing call sites
        that only need a boolean should use `result.ready`.

        Two layered checks make this robust against transient redraw
        frames that single-poll heuristics get fooled by:

        1. The adapter's per-agent `is_ready(pane)` heuristic must return
           True (these are the per-agent matrix predicates).
        2. The pane content must be **identical** across `stable_polls`
           consecutive observations separated by `poll_interval` seconds.

        Codex specifically motivates check (2): its `• Working (Ns ...)`
        timer updates each second, and tmux capture occasionally catches
        a frame between updates where `Working` is briefly absent — a
        naive `is_ready` poll then false-passes. Requiring content
        identity across N captures filters those transients out
        (a still-rendering TUI doesn't produce identical captures).

        `warmup` skips the pre-generation window (the small gap between
        `send_message` and the agent rendering its generation marker)
        so the first ready observation isn't a stale idle frame.

        Returns an `AwaitResult`:
            - `.ready=True, .reason="ready"` when a stable ready state was
               reached;
            - `.ready=False, .timed_out=True, .reason="timeout_unstable"`
               when readiness was observed but never held stable;
            - `.ready=False, .timed_out=True, .reason="timeout_never_ready"`
               when readiness was never observed before deadline.

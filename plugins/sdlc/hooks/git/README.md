# Git Observability Hooks

Git hooks that emit observability events for tracking developer workflows and agent-assisted coding sessions.

## Overview

These hooks capture git operations and emit JSONL events to `.agentic/analytics/events.jsonl`. This enables:

- **Session Analytics**: Track commits, branches, and merges per coding session
- **Token Efficiency**: Measure tokens added/removed vs tokens used by AI
- **Code Velocity**: Monitor code reaching stable branches
- **Workflow Patterns**: Analyze development patterns over time

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** - Required for the installer. Also used for JSON escaping in hooks (with bash fallback if unavailable).
- **Git 2.9+** - For global hooks support via `core.hooksPath`.
- **Bash** - The hooks are bash scripts.

### Windows Notes

On Windows, these hooks require **Git Bash** (included with Git for Windows) to execute. The hooks are bash scripts and will not run directly in PowerShell or CMD. Git for Windows automatically uses Git Bash to run hooks, so no additional configuration is needed.

## Installation

### Single Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your repo
cd /path/to/your/repo

# Run the installer (Python 3.8+ required)
python /path/to/primitives/v1/hooks/git/install.py
```

### Global (All Repositories)

```bash
# Install globally
python /path/to/primitives/v1/hooks/git/install.py --global
```

### Uninstall

```bash
# Remove from current repo
python /path/to/primitives/v1/hooks/git/install.py --uninstall

# Remove global hooks
python /path/to/primitives/v1/hooks/git/install.py --global --uninstall
```

### Windows

The installer is cross-platform and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux:

```powershell
# PowerShell
python C:\path\to\primitives\v1\hooks\git\install.py
```

## Hooks Included

| Hook | Event Type | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `post-commit` | `git_commit` | Tracks commits with files changed, insertions/deletions, and token estimates |
| `post-checkout` | `git_branch_created` / `git_branch_switched` | Tracks branch creation and switches |
| `post-merge` | `git_merge_completed` | Tracks merges, especially to stable branches (main, master, etc.) |
| `post-rewrite` | `git_commits_rewritten` | Tracks rebases and amends |
| `pre-push` | `git_push_started` | Tracks push operations |

## Event Schema

### git_commit

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-12-09T10:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "git_commit",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "commit_hash": "a1b2c3d4...",
  "commit_message": "feat: add user authentication",
  "author": "Developer Name",
  "branch": "feat/auth",
  "files_changed": 5,
  "insertions": 120,
  "deletions": 30,
  "estimated_tokens_added": 450,
  "estimated_tokens_removed": 112
}
```

### git_branch_created / git_branch_switched

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-12-09T10:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "git_branch_created",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "branch": "feat/new-feature",
  "prev_ref": "abc123...",
  "new_ref": "def456..."
}
```

### git_merge_completed

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-12-09T10:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "git_merge_completed",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "target_branch": "main",
  "merged_ref": "abc123...",
  "is_stable_branch": true,
  "commits_merged": 3
}
```

### git_commits_rewritten

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-12-09T10:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "git_commits_rewritten",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "branch": "feat/auth",
  "rewrite_type": "rebase",
  "commits_rewritten": 5
}
```

### git_push_started

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-12-09T10:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "git_push_started",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "remote": "origin",
  "branch": "feat/auth",
  "commits_to_push": 3
}
```

## Configuration

### Analytics Path

Set `ANALYTICS_PATH` environment variable to customize the output location:

```bash
export ANALYTICS_PATH="/path/to/custom/events.jsonl"
```

Default: `.agentic/analytics/events.jsonl`

### Session ID

The hooks use `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` or `AEF_SESSION_ID` environment variables to correlate git events with coding sessions. If neither is set, `"unknown"` is used.

## Token Estimation

Token estimates use a simple `characters / 4` approximation, which is reasonably accurate for most code. For more precise estimates, post-process the events with a tokenizer like `tiktoken`.

## Integration with AEF Collector

These events are designed to work with the AEF Collector, which:

1. Watches the JSONL file for new events
2. Converts them to `CollectedEvent` types
3. Streams them to the observability dashboard
4. Stores them for historical analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Hooks not firing

1. Check if hooks are installed: `ls -la .git/hooks/`
2. Verify hooks are executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/*`
3. Check for global hooks override: `git config core.hooksPath`

### Events not appearing

1. Check the analytics file exists: `cat .agentic/analytics/events.jsonl`
2. Verify write permissions to the directory
3. Check for errors in hook output: `git commit -v` (verbose mode)

### Backup hooks

If you had existing hooks, they're backed up as `*.bak`. To restore:

```bash
cd .git/hooks
mv post-commit.bak post-commit
```

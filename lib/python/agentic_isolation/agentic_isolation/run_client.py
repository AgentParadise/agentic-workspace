"""Thin Python client for the Rust ``itmux run`` binary (Plan B, Task 7).

This module is deliberately *thin*: it owns no orchestration and no business
logic. All of that lives in the Rust ``itmux run`` subcommand. The client's
sole responsibilities are:

1. Mirror the wire contract (`AgentRunSpec` / `AgentRunResult` / `AgentRunEvent`)
   as strict Pydantic v2 models whose field names match the Rust serde names
   exactly. See the authoritative source at
   ``providers/workspaces/interactive-tmux/driver-rs/src/run/contract.rs`` and
   the generated JSON schema under ``.../driver-rs/docs/contract/``.
2. Spawn ``itmux run`` in JSON mode, stream the stdout event JSONL, parse each
   line into a typed :data:`AgentRunEvent`, and return the terminal
   :class:`AgentRunResult`.
3. Never leak a child process. The child (and any ``docker exec`` grandchildren
   it spawns) runs in its own process group; on cancel / crash / timeout the
   whole group is signalled ``SIGTERM`` then, after a grace period, ``SIGKILL``
   (R10 process-group cleanup).

Supersedes the hand-written Python contract proposed in #240 - that contract is
replaced by this Rust-mirrored one and #240 is closed separately.

    The child is started with ``start_new_session=True`` so it leads its own
    process group whose pgid equals the leader pid. Signalling the group reaches
    the Rust process AND any ``docker exec`` grandchildren it spawned.

    Ordering (codex must-fix 1+2, refined):

    1. ``SIGTERM`` the whole group FIRST so the Rust leader can run its own
       graceful container teardown; a premature ``SIGKILL`` would orphan the
       docker CONTAINER (the orchestrator tears it down on graceful signals,
       see #248).
    2. Wait a bounded grace period WITHOUT reaping the leader.
    3. ``SIGKILL`` the whole group to reap any survivor (a docker-exec
       grandchild can outlive the leader).
    4. ONLY THEN reap the leader zombie.

    PID-reuse safety - the load-bearing invariant: the leader must stay
    UNREAPED (alive or zombie) until AFTER the final group signal. An unreaped
    leader keeps its pid (== pgid) reserved by the kernel, so every ``killpg``
    below provably targets OUR group and can never hit a recycled pgid. This is
    why the grace phase must NOT call ``proc.poll()`` / ``proc.wait()`` /
    ``os.waitpid`` - reaping the zombie frees the pid and the pgid could be
    recycled by a concurrent fork before step 3. ``killpg(pgid, 0)`` also cannot
    detect "descendants gone" while the unreaped zombie still occupies the
    group, so there is no correct non-reaping early exit: we simply sleep the
    (short) grace. Teardown latency is an acceptable trade for the guarantee.
    The early ``returncode`` guard covers a second teardown pass: if the leader
    was already reaped, never signal its possibly-recycled pgid again.

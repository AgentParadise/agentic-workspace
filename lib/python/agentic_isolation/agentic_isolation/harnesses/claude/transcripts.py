"""Transcript extraction for the `claude` (Claude Code CLI) harness.

Claude Code writes one JSONL transcript file per session under
`~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session_id>.jsonl` inside the workspace
(including any delegated sub-agent session started via `claude -p`,
which writes its own file with its own session id - see issue #792).
`ClaudeTranscriptSource` recovers every such file after the fact via the
workspace's `ExecFn`, never by reaching into the filesystem directly:
the workspace may be a remote container, so all I/O goes through
`exec_fn`.

Distinguishes a legitimate empty harvest (workspace never wrote
`~/.claude/projects`) from a real transport failure (permission denied,
unreachable filesystem, ...). An exit code alone cannot carry this
distinction: `ExecFn` itself may fail transport with any exit code
(including one a shell script happens to pick for "absent"), and `find`
reserves no exit code for "the directory never existed" - see issue #792
(round 2 finding 2). Only an EXACT stdout match against this marker (exit
0) normalizes to a clean empty `TranscriptExtractionResult`; any non-zero
exit is unconditionally a real error reported through `errors`. The
listing command used to unconditionally force a zero exit code on `find`
failure via a bare `|| true`, and later a fixed "absent" exit code that a
transport failure could coincidentally reproduce - both swallowed real
failures as a clean empty result.

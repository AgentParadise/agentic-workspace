# SeshMagic provider-specific health check (ADR-040).

# NOT wired into the automatic preflight. Unlike the memory capability's
# ProviderSpecificCheck, agentic_session_store.doctor's check list (Task 3)
# has no provider-specific hook, and this script is not invoked by
# /opt/agentic/capabilities/session-store/doctor. It is a manual diagnostic
# only — run it by hand (see the capability README's "Running the doctor
# by hand" section) after sourcing the adapter's exported env. Reports
# JSON to stdout; exit 0 = pass, exit 1 = fail.
